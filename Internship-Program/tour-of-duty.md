  <This Could Be You!>

At Pinpoint, we have a passion for investing in others. Because this passion is so central to who we are, we are building an industry leading internship program.

Three core values have guided the development of our internship:

1. Access - You will have consistent access to our founders and other top-tier professionals.
1. Artifacts - You will create a high quality artifact or participate in the development/shipment of a product.
1. Investment - We will invest in you! You will learn valuable skills and lessons working with our team. We believe we will gain implicitly through this process.

  <The Alliance>
</p>

In order to execute on these values, we have adopted a rotational Tour of Duty framework from [The Alliance](https://www.amazon.com/Alliance-Managing-Talent-Networked-Age/dp/1625275773) (Hoffman, Casnocha, Yeh). This will be a structured, 30-day internship with very clear goals and objectives for both you and Pinpoint. The Alliance framework will help us create trust and mutual engagement through performing on the key elements of your internship:

1. Build a Relationship - Tours of duty will encourage us to meet early and develop mutual expectations for our relationship and work. In an alliance, we understand that our short-term commitment to one another will kick off a long-term, mutually beneficial relationship.
1. Build a System - Often, the greatest creativity and productivity occur within structure. We have created a 30 day system for your tour of duty, which we have outlined below.
1. Build Expectations - In developing expectations, we will have clear goals for both you and Pinpoint. We want you to work hard, but we want you to know know how you will benefit from your hard work
1. Meet Regularly - **Communication is key.** You will meet with your manager on a weekly basis to assess your progress and determine if there is any need for course correction. It is perfectly appropriate and encouraged to contact your manager with any questions you have concerning your assignments. We love Slack and you can find us on it at most times during the work day.

## Tour of Duty Structure

	* Have a preliminary conversation with your manager to develop expectations for your time with us.
	* Review internship FAQ doc on GitHub to learn more about internship, add any additional questions you have, this will be periodically reviewed by Pinpoint leadership.

	* Tour renewal discussion. Discuss with you manager whether you will stay with Pinpoint for another tour of duty. It must be decided that it is mutually beneficial to both parties to transition into another tour. If you stay for another tour, what will it look like? Will you begin a new project or continue the current one?
	* Begin to gameplan transition of the project you have worked on if you will not be continuing with Pinpoint. Is it complete? What information is necessary for the person or team to whom it will be handed off? 
1. Monday/Fourth Week 
	* Presentation preparation. Later this week, you will be making a presentation to the team on what you accomplished with Pinpoint. Deliverables should be nearly complete. Review with manager and make any necessary tweaks to prepare for presentation/delivery. Talk about your process, what you created, and how it will benefit you and the company. 
	* If you will be staying on for another tour, review the purpose of this tour and solidify your goals with your manager.
	* If you worked on a project that requires implementation, the implementation should happen this week with a handoff, if necessary.

	* Present your work to the team. 
1. Monday-Tuesday/Fifth Week
	* Wind down - If there is any follow up needed on your presentation/implementation, take care of it.
	* Answer any of your own FAQ questions for which you have identified answers, ask any new questions you still have unanswered.
	* Final assessment - If this is your last tour, you will receive feedback concerning your work and progress. 
	* Final assesment of Pinpoint - We will also ask you to honestly assess your time with Pinpoint. Did you feel that your manager and other leadership served you well? What did you learn from your tour? Will what you learned benefit you in your career? What is your overall take on company culture?
