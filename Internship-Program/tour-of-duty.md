  <b>This Could Be You!:</b><br>
</p>

At Pinpoint, we have a passion for investing in others. Because this passion is so central to who we are, we are building an industry leading internship program.

Three core values have guided the development of our internship:

1. Access - You will have consistent access to our founders and other top-tier professionals.
1. Artifacts - You will create a high quality artifact or participate in the development/shipment of a product.
1. Investment - We will invest in you! You will learn valuable skills and lessons working with our team. We believe we will gain implicitly through this process.

  <b>The Alliance:</b><br>
</p>

In order to execute on these values, we have adopted a rotational Tour of Duty framework from [The Alliance](https://www.amazon.com/Alliance-Managing-Talent-Networked-Age/dp/1625275773) (Hoffman, Casnocha, Yeh). This will be a structured, 30-day internship with very clear goals and objectives for both you and Pinpoint. The Alliance framework will help us create trust and mutual engagement through performing on the key elements of your internship:

1. Build a Relationship - Tours of duty will encourage us to meet early and develop mutual expectations for our relationship and work. In an alliance, we understand that our short-term commitment to one another will kick off a long-term, mutually beneficial relationship.
1. Build a System - Often, the greatest creativity and productivity occur within structure. We have created a 30 day system for your tour of duty, which we have outlined below.
1. Build Expectations - In developing expectations, we will have clear goals for both you and Pinpoint. We want you to work hard, but we want you to know know how you will benefit from your hard work
1. Meet Regularly - **Communication is key.** You will meet with your manager on a weekly basis to assess your progress and determine if there is any need for course correction. It is perfectly appropriate and encouraged to contact your manager with any questions you have concerning your assignments. We love Slack and you can find us on it at most times during the work day.

## Tour of Duty Structure

1. The week preceding your internship - 
	*Read The Alliance. This will help you better understand the Tour of Duty Structure. Pinpoint will provide a copy.
	* Create a Github account and familiarize yourself with it. GitHub is Pinpoint's system of record and it is critical that you have some knowledge of it. Github provides great tutorials [here](https://guides.github.com/). 
	*Have a preliminary conversation with your manager to develop expectations for your time with us.
1. Monday/Week One
	*Introductions - Meet with your manager, at least one of our founders, and other team members.  
	*Company and culture orientation.
	*Complete Tour of Duty Questionnaire with manager and establish your goals for your month-long internship.
1. Monday/Week Two
	*Status update. Review your internship thus far and assess your progress with manager.
1. Monday/Week Three
	*Status update. Review your internship thus far and assess your progress with manager.
1. Monday/Fourth Week 
	*Presentation preparation. Deliverables should be nearly complete. Review with manager and make any necessary tweaks to prepare for presentation/delevery.
	*Discuss transition with your manager. If both parties are happy with your tour, this is a great time to discuss a follow up tour if you feel it would be beneficial.
	*If you worked on a project that requires implementation, the implementation should happen this week with a handoff, if necessary.
1. Friday/Fourth Week 
	*Present your work to the team. Talk about your process, what you created, and how it will benefit you and the company. 
1. Monday-Tuesday/Fifth Week
	*Wind down - If there is any follow up needed on your presentation/implementation, take care of it.
	*Final assessment - You will receive feedback concerning your work and progress. We will also ask you to honestly assess your time with Pinpoint.
