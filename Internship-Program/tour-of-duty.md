# Tours of Duty

At Pinpoint, we have a passion for investing in others. As such, are building an industry leading internship program.

Three core values have guided the development of our internship:

## Access

You will have consistent access to our founders and other top-tier professionals.

## Artifacts

You will create a high quality artifact or participant in the development/shipment of a product.

## Investment

We will invest in you! You will learn valuable skills and lessons working with our team. We believe we will gain implicitly through this process

In order to execute on these values, we have adopted a Tour of Duty framework from The Alliance (Hoffman, Casnocha, Yeh). This will be a structured, 30-day internship with very clear goals and objectives for both you and Pinpoint. The Alliance framework will help us create trust and mutual engagement through performing on the key elements of your internship:

## Build a Relationship

Tours of duty will encourage us to meet early and develop mutual expectations for our relationship and work. In an alliance, we are able to understand that our short-term commitment to one another will kick off a long-term, mutually beneficial relationship.

## Build a System

Often, the greatest creativity and productivity occur within structure. We have created a 30 day system for your tour of duty, which we have outlined below.

## Build Expectations

In developing expectations, we will have clear goals for both you and Pinpoint. We want you to work hard, but we want you to know know how you will benefit from your hard work

## Meet Regularly

**Communication is key.** You will meet with your manager on a weekly basis to assess your progress and determine if there is any need for course correction. It is perfectly appropriate and encouraged to contact your manager with any questions you have concerning your assignments. We love Slack!

## Tour of Duty Structure

The week preceding your internship - We will gift you a copy of The Alliance. Please read it prior to the start of your internship. This will help you have a better understanding of our purpose in this design and how it will benefit you as an intern. You will also have a preliminary conversation with your manager wherein you will develop preliminary expectations for your time with us.

Monday/First Week - Introductions. You will meet with your manager, other team members and at least one of our founders. You will have an orientation in which you will learn about Pinpoint and our culture. You and your manager will go over the Tour of Duty Questionnaire together and establish your goals for your month-long internship.

Monday/Second Week - Status update. You and your manager will review your internship thus far and assess your progress.

Monday/Third Week - Status update. You and your manager will review your internship thus far and assess your progress.

Monday/Fourth Week - Presentation preparation. At this point, your deliverables will be nearly complete. You and your manager will review them and make any tweaks on your work, you will prepare your work to be presented to the team. In addition, you will discuss your way forward with your manager. If both parties are happy with your tour, this is a great time to discuss a follow up tour if you feel it would be beneficial.

Friday/Fourth Week - You will present your work to the team. You will have an opportunity to talk about your process, what you created and how it will benefit you and the company. If you deliver a product that requires implementation, this will be a great time to do so.

Monday-Tuesday/Fifth Week - Wind down. If there is any follow up needed on your presentation/implementation, these will be days to do it. On your last day, you will have a final assessment of your progress during your 30-day internship. At this time, we will also ask you to honestly assess your time with Pinpoint. It is our hope that with the trust we have built over the past month, constructive feedback will make you a more marketable employee, Pinpoint a better company, and will assist in the continuous evolution of an industry standard-bearing internship program.
