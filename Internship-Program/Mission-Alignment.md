Activity 1: Prior to meeting with Manager

Mission and Values Alignment

Objective: Identify your top 3 career aspirations for the next 6-12 to discuss with your manager to learn how they align with the mission and values of Pinpoint.

Part 1: Identify top 3 career aspirations

Imagine your career in 6-12 months. Record your top three career-related goals.
What do you want to be doing?
Where do you want to be?
What are skills you want to grow?
To whom do you want to be connected?
What new experiences do you want to have?
 
Part 2: To be completed with manager: Align your goals with Pinpoint's mission and values

Discuss with your manager how/if your aspirations align to Pinpoint's mission and values.

Keep in mind that the objective isn't to have 100% alignment. It is to get clarity about how/if your goals align.

Write down:
Which goals align and how?
Which goals don't align and why/how?

Next steps: Use your aligned goals to plan what you will do during your tour.

Activity 2: Your Next Play

Objective: Identify ways you can incorporate your career aspirations into your tour of duty.

The purpose of this activity is to begin thinking about what steps you can take to realize your goals. These ideas can inform what your next tour could look like. The purpose is not to write an entire tour. By identifying clear ways you can integrate your goals in your next play, you lay the foundation for designing a tour that meets your goals.

Brainstorm all possible ways you could realize each goal.

In Activity #1, you identified your top aligned goals. Now brainstorm and write down all the ways that you can fulfill each goal.

Ask yourself the following questions to begin identifying things you can do and ways you can achieve each goal.
What steps do you need to take?
What does success look like?
What resources might you need?
Who could help?
What existing skills could you leverage?
Are there any smaller steps that could be taken now?
Are there any obstacles you'll need to address?
